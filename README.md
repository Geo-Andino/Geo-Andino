- 👋 Hi, I’m @Geo-Andino
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about computer science, video games, business, and STEM. I enjoy playing sports and spending time with friends, family, and my girlfriend. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python with a previous background in Java. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for advice on how to get into the programming world without a computer science degree as I am currently studying mechanical engineering without the option to transfer into comp-sci. 
- 📫 How to reach me via email: jovyandino@gmail.com
